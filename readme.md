Nearly 3 hours was required to complete the full static page.

### What I learned

This is the css design code snippet of the navbar class of SEO website. My flexbox conception are getting more cleared.

```css
.nav-list .list {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 2rem;
  font-size: 2.2rem;
  font-weight: 500;
  justify-content: space-between;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
